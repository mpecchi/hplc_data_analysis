The example is available in the example folder (with necessary data) and demonstrates how to use the hplc_data_analysis package for basic High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) data analysis and visualization. It covers the initial setup, data preparation, and plotting of average and standard deviation for a specific parameter. The script sets up the project folder, initializes a Project instance, and processes HPLC data files. It then creates a parameter report, assigns colors to compounds for visualization purposes, and finally plots the data. This example is ideal for getting started with analyzing HPLC data using our package.
